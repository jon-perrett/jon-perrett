- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jon-perrett
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science, machine learning and home automation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cloud computing.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - via github.

I'm currently working on:
- Methods of automatically detecting the language of source code (currently a private repo)
- A recommendation system for what to have for dinner (currently Private)

Projects I've put to one side (but will revisit):
- Data visualisation using the Garmin Connect API and the Strava API  
- Environment monitoring using ESP32 and sensors (currently a private repo)

Projects I want to do in the future:
- My own implementation of scikit learn to better understand what it does under-the-hood
- Neural networks from scratch in multiple languages
